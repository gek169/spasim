(* VOXEL CUBE DISPLAYING A TURING RD SYSTEM ON EACH FACE
FOR GOOD MEASURE, LET'S CONNECT ALL THE FACES AND MAKE
THE WHOLE SURFACE A TOPOLOGICAL TORUS
O WAIT. I DON'T THINK SO. A CUBE IS A SPHERE TOPOLOGICALLY WHAT
WAS I THINKING OBVIOUSLY IT CAN'T MAP TO A TORUS
NO WONDER I WAS THROWN OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
WE'LL JUST HAVE THE SAME PATTERN REPEAT ON EACH SIDE
